This code was developed with MATLAB 2014b.

This repository represents the code that was used for the analysis and figures presented in Sombric et al. 2017.  This repository includes code developed within the Sensorimotor Learning Lab for standard data processing of all collected data types (including kinematics, kinetics, EMG, etc.).  The most up to date version of this code repository can be found here https://github.com/PittSMLlab/labTools.

If you wish to run this code, you can use data available on my figshare to generate all analysis and figures (https://figshare.com/account/home#/projects/68993).  The script to run in order to replicate the figures from the 2017 paper is called "ImplicitSwitchingStudy_FigShare" and can be used in conjunction with the data available on figshare.
